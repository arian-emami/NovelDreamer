## Abstract
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in text generation, but challenges remain, particularly in crafting long-form narratives that maintain consistency in topic and style, engage readers, and preserve coherence. NovelDreamer addresses these issues through a multifaceted approach. It employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method, utilizing samples from related works sourced from Wikiquote to enhance stylistic and thematic consistency. To ensure narrative engagement, NovelDreamer integrates established story structures, such as the Hero's Journey and Freytagâ€™s Pyramid, guiding the LLM in crafting compelling and well-structured stories. Additionally, by pre-planning the story into chapters and acts, NovelDreamer facilitates the creation of coherent and captivating long-form narratives. The code for NovelDreamer is publicly available.
